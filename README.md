# Portfolio-Projects
This is a part 1 of 4 portfolio projects which uses MS SQL Server Management Studio to analyse and generate different queries for the Covid Data Base which is an open source data base.
The code contains some basic and advanced SQL queries such as number of people vaccinated in a particular country, percent of people vaccinated, count and maximun covid cases.
The codes include use of statements such as JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY along with CTE and TEMPORARY TABLES and at last a sample VIEW is generated which will be used for further projects.

The complete project is inspired by Alex Freberg who also helped me throughout the project.
